  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>Alert pops up an alert box in front of the screen which you have to click "OK" to make go away. Console.log is just like "puts" -- it puts a line of text on the screen.</p>

  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>If someone's time-limited login session was about to expire due to inactivity on the page.</p>

  <h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>It's obnoxious because you can't do anything else on the page until you click OK and make it go away.</p>
