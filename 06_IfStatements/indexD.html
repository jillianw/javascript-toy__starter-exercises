  <h2>Does it matter what order your if-statements are in?</h2>
  <p> </p>

  <h2>When testing ranges, did you use &&, ||, or something else entirely (e.g. nested if-statements)? If you used &&, why is that a better choice than || (and vice-versa)?</h2>
  <p> </p>

  <h2>What types of input produce a value of NaN after parsing? Is it important to check for NaN values? Is it possible for a NaN value to trigger any of the other if-statements? If so, how and why?</h2>
  <p> </p>

  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
